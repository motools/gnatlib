Notice this actually returns the more accurate result for 'J-Dilla' the pseudonym
used by Jay Dee when the album 'Donuts' was released.

KNOWN ISSUES:

	2009-20-04
	- @param use_cache=False does not seem to work correctly - sorry you've got to use the cache for now...
	- turning off verbose seems to not work :-/
	- no clean up of the ./cache directory - you have to do this yourself
	- we use dbtune.org/musicbrainz URIs - it is not clear this is best
	- no support for PUID MusicDNS lookup
